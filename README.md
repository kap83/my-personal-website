Reading should be an adventure! Tired of reviews and ratings? Of agonizing over which summary seems the most interesting? Do you just want to grab a book and go? 
Author Search uses Open Library’s API to provide you with a short list of books an author has written. In the input box, enter either the author’s full name or last name and click “search”. In moments, you’ll be provided with the first five books the author published. 

If none of those titles seemed interesting to you, just click clear and search again!
